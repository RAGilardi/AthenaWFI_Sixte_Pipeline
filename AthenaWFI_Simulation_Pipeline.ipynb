    "## 0) Introduction\n",
    "This Pipeline was developed as a Master Thesis Project by Riccardo Aurelio Gilardi, master undergraduee in Astrophysics at University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy), between November 2020 and November 2021 under the supervision of Dr.Iacopo Bartalucci of IASF-INAF Milano (Italy) and Prof.Monica Colpi of University of Milano-Bicocca.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter-Notebook contains an extended explanation of each and every command prompted to produce simulated images for the Athena WFI imager using SIXTE, with many technical and theoretical references and, where possible, alternative commands for every passage.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will begin showing in **section 1** *how to produce a simple image and spectra for a pointlike object with a power law emission spectra*. This can be considered an exercise to check if every command gives the expected outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **section 2** I will make a more complex example, showing *how to produce images and spectra for an extended source, wether coming from another satellite or a simulation*, with a background and pointlike sources and with some instrument corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same directory to this file you will find some example analysis created starting from simulated objects, chandra images or simpler simputs. With these examples you will find scripts I used to obtain my results, which are customary and auxiliary, but not strictly required to complete the simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will try to keep this file and the whole repository updated. Feel free to send any observation or question to the **github project's issue tracker**: https://github.com/RAGilardi/AthenaWFI_Sixte_Pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tecnical note:\n",
    "Even though with notebooks like this you could write and execute some bash commands (beginning a code cell with %%bash. This solution seems to work well with xspec scripts), at the moment of writing this I wasn't able to execute in a notebook many of the lines of code that required interactions, such as most of ciao and sixte command. Because of that, consider this as a source from which copy and paste lines into a terminal, more than an executable script.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this restriction to notebooks ever change, I will gladly make this file an executable pipeline, bypassing the use of terminals, if not needed."
