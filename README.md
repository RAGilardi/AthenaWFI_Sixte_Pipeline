# AthenaWFI_Sixte_Pipeline
This project presents a series of command pipelines to produce simulated images from Athena WFI using SIXTE, Ciao and xspec.

The notebook "AthenaWFI_Simulation_Pipeline.ipynb" is a complete overview of the procedures needed to pilot the codes.

I added a few examples (also described in the jupyter notebook) to show how to explore and manipulate the pipeline parameters and different sections.

This Pipeline was developed as a Master Thesis Project by Riccardo Aurelio Gilardi, a master graduate in Astrophysics at the University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy), between November 2020 and March 2022 under the supervision of Dr Iacopo Bartalucci of IASF-INAF Milano (Italy) and Prof.Monica Colpi of University of Milano-Bicocca.

The thesis is attached to the project.

Feel free to send any observation or question to the **GitHub project's issue tracker**: https://github.com/RAGilardi/AthenaWFI_Sixte_Pipeline.
