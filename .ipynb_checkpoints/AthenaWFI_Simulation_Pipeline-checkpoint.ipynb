    "## 0) Introduction\n",
    "This Pipeline was developed as a Master Thesis Project by Riccardo Aurelio Gilardi, master undergraduee in Astrophysics at University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy), between November 2020 and November 2021 under the supervision of Dr.Iacopo Bartalucci of IASF-INAF Milano (Italy) and Prof.Monica Colpi of University of Milano-Bicocca.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter-Notebook contains an extended explanation of each and every command prompted to produce simulated images for the Athena WFI imager using SIXTE, with many technical and theoretical references and, where possible, alternative commands for every passage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though with notebooks like this you could write and execute some kind of bash commands (beginning a code cell with %%bash works well with xspec scripts), at the moment of writing\n",
    "\n",
    "I will try to keep this file and the whole repository updated. Feel free to send any observation or question to the **github project's issue tracker**: https://github.com/RAGilardi/AthenaWFI_Sixte_Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same directory to this file you will find some example analysis created starting from simulated objects, chandra images or simpler simputs. With these examples you will find scripts I used to obtain my results, which are customary and auxiliary, but not strictly required to complete the simulations."
