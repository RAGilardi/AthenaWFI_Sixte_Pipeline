    "## 0) Introduction\n",
    "This Pipeline was developed as a Master Thesis Project by Riccardo Aurelio Gilardi, master undergraduee in Astrophysics at University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy), between November 2020 and November 2021 under the supervision of Dr.Iacopo Bartalucci of IASF-INAF Milano (Italy) and Prof.Monica Colpi of University of Milano-Bicocca.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter-Notebook contains an extended explanation of each and every command prompted to produce simulated images for the Athena WFI imager using SIXTE, with many technical and theoretical references and, where possible, alternative commands for every passage.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will begin showing in **section 1** *how to produce a simple image and spectra for a pointlike object with a power law emission spectra*. This can be considered an exercise to check if every command gives the expected outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **section 2** I will make a more complex example, showing *how to produce images and spectra for an extended source, wether coming from another satellite or a simulation*, with a background and pointlike sources and with some instrument corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same directory to this file you will find some example analysis created starting from simulated objects, chandra images or simpler simputs. With these examples you will find scripts I used to obtain my results, which are customary and auxiliary, but not strictly required to complete the simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will try to keep this file and the whole repository updated. Feel free to send any observation or question to the **github project's issue tracker**: https://github.com/RAGilardi/AthenaWFI_Sixte_Pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use these codes for your work, please cite the author of this work referring to this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tecnical notes:\n",
    "1) Even though with notebooks like this you could write and execute some bash commands (beginning a code cell with %%bash. This solution seems to work well with xspec scripts), at the moment of writing this I wasn't able to execute in a notebook many of the lines of code that required interactions, such as most of ciao and sixte command. Because of that, consider this as a source from which copy and paste lines into a terminal, more than an executable script.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this restriction to notebooks ever change, I will gladly make this file an executable pipeline, bypassing the use of terminals, if not needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Rather than writing each command in this pipeline as a single line, I preferred for simplicity to use ciao punlearn/pset functions. So that even changing a single parameter in the pipeline became more simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is totally not necessary"

    "\n",
    "The param is related to the model through the **paraNames** parameter, while the keywoards **paramsNumValues** and **paramsLogScale** refers to the number of intervals in which the parameter values are divided between its minimum and maximum and wether these intervals are to be considered on a logarithmic scale or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of simputmultispec over other methods is related to its versatility and the many parameters which it makes possible to manipulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**side-note:** SIXTE manual underline how this is a function most suitable for 2d input maps as parameter files cannot be deprojected. In the case of 3D input data, the manual shows how to produce a simulation using functions such as **simuputmulticell**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.1) Input maps\n",
    "While the function parameters are all similar to those used with simputfile in the case of the point-like source, a **few words** can be spent **on the input counts map**:\n",
    "- In the case of **maps from simulations** we want a **cluster-only** **normalized counts map** with **no background photons**\n",
    "- In the case of **maps from real data reduction** we want a **background subtracted exposition time-normalized counts map**. We also want to **cut our counts and paramater maps to include only the area of the source**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **cutting input maps for real data** is required because the simput creation impose a spectral model to all the photons in the map and we cannot have an input map from real data with only counts from the source: if we created the simput from the whole image, even though counts are normalized and background subtracted, sixte would interpret the whole image as something radiating as described in the spectral model (like a \"ccd-shaped cluster\"!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cutting the input maps requires some really strong hypothesis on where the source brightness as seen on the real data get submerged by background emission. This could be made less impactfull on the results remembering that the simulation can only use data which were also avaiable above the background in the original image: so the background limit from the original data analysis should be considered a good estimator to the radius for the cut, while everything much over that limit was not directly derived from the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem as a strong limit to the potential outcomes of simulated images with sixte, but we can say that the analysis of simulations made with another instrument input map would probably be more useful as a comparing/reference tool of the results, rather than an investigating instrument. On the other hand a simulation produced starting from simulated objects could instead use for physical and instrumental limits analysis!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.2) Fluxes\n",
    "For what concerns the fluxes:\n",
    "- In the case of simput created starting from **simulated objects counts maps**, it is **customary to choose a value for the source and background fluxes**.\n",
    "- In the case of simput created starting from **other instruments counts maps of real object** is **important to use the correct flux for the source and the background in the input energy range of choice**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For example:\n",
    "when **utilizing chandra images as input** for the simputmultispec functions, I chose to use the 0.7-2.5 keV energy range, which has the highest effective area for Chandra and I **derived the source count rate from the original Chandra evt files using ds9**. This simply by: \n",
    "- selecting my source region\n",
    "- summing every counts within\n",
    "- dividing by the exposure time of the image\n",
    "this after subtracting the counts from an equal area region from a sourceless part of the image (the background)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the **spectra file** from the original data have informations about the exposition time, also **xspec show rate functions can be used** to find a count rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Online, can also be found **many catalogue estimates for known sources fluxes in most energy bands**. For example see https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/\n",
    "\n",
    "The **count rate** can be used as an **input in any pimms website** (with other informations such as nh, z and spectral model) **to derive a flux**. For example see https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Tools/w3pimms/w3pimms.pl\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience all of these methods always gave similar and coherent results for the flux value. Small enough they never influenced the simulation results. If there are any inconsistencies in flux values for the same object in the same band with the same conditions, there might be an issue with the data you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.3) Background Simputs\n",
    "A notable difference with the case of the simple example of section one is that for a complete simulation we might also want to produce a **simput file** for the **background**. In the example below and in the Example directory I create a simput file for the **sky compontent of the background** and one for the **particle/instrumental component of the background**. \n",
    "\n",
    "These two have the same spectral model and their input counts maps can be created customary or starting from an empty space image of the region of interest. In my case, for simplicity, I chose to generate these maps with python and had them have random values distributed as a gaussian. Their parameter files makes reference to the three normalization in their spectral model and are also produced in python as copy of the brightness map multiplied for a constant numerical factor. My scripts for generating the background input maps and parameter maps, which are extremely simplicistic, customary and optional, are both in the Examples/script directory of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sky background simput can be used as a secondary simput for the complete image simulation, in addition to the cluster simput and any other eventual simput.\n",

    "The particle background simput is a bit more complicated subject: SIXTE uses instrument calibration file to model the instrumental background and add it automatically to every simulation, so its not needed to create a particle background simput to add to the source complete simulation. Instead, this kind of simput could be used for example to create a \"flat image\" to be subtracted from the \"complete cluster image\" made from the cluster and sky background simput. This is not showed in this pipeline, but for example the python library pyproffit requires explicitally a particle background only image for its brightness modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also see in the next sections how the spectra derived from the simulations made with only the particle background simput spectra could also be subtracted to every cluster and sky background spectra to obtain better spectral fits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**technical side-note:** At the time of writing this version of the pipeline, the official athena instrument files for the particle background rate is a constant function for every energy bin. While this is not technically very accurate, it didn't seem to create any major issue with the results and anyhow it might be too early in Athena developement to create a more precise instrument background model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simputmultispec functions for the two kinds of background is created almost in the same way. The only difference in this case is that the two input counts maps have different normalization. This is because while for the sky background we can measure a realistic count rate, to measure the particle/instrumental background we should use a 0-counts map (only instrumental noise, no sources). Unfortunately sixte at the moment doesn't permit the creation of a simput starting from a uniform or too low-normed input map, so to create a particle-background we can use a random map with counts distributed on a gaussian with a much lower average value than the one used for the sky background (I often used a ratio of $\\sim10^{-5}$ for the two normalization with no issues)."

    "The **WFI simulation and imaging scripts** for a complete extended source is **mostly the same** as in the case of the simple point-like source example, but I want to overview the **few major differences** that makes the whole simulation a bit more refined and realistic:\n",
    "- The **\"complete\" simulation** can be constructed using a combination of the **cluster simput with**, the **sky background simput** (the particle background is added by sixte in the script) and an eventual **point-like sources simput**. The former can be built with a bash script as a catalogue of sources as shown in section 1.2 or, as I finally did, you can simply use a real catalogue as che Chandra Deep Field South Survey as a source of realistic data and create a catalogue using any number of real sources taken from that. In the Examples/Script directory of the github project you can find a customary and optional script I made to create a simput catalogue for pointlike sources in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To take into account the dithering movement of the satellite, we can create and add to the inputs for athenawfisim an **attitude file**, describing the change in position of the satellite during the observation. This will help showing all the photons coming from the regions between WFI sensors, which would be dark otherwise. In the Examples/Script directory of the github project you can find a customary and optional script I made to create an attitude file based on the one showed in the sixte manual for Athena.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For some kind of subsequent analysis **we may be required to produce an image of the only particle (or sky) background**. This I made in my example simulation for an extended object (in the examples directory). The script is analogous to that of the complete image, with only a single simput. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Below I'm also showing a **simulation** of the **only particle background** with a **longer exposure time** than the complete image. This simulation will be needed **for the spectral analysis** and its longer exposure time is justified by the fact that a real spectral observation would be longer than an imaging one and also by the fact that my analysis of temperature profiles is based on the hypothesis that the spectral model for the background was known and constant, as also WFI instrument files I used involved. Then the longer exposure for the instrumental/particle background only image provided a better statistics on each bin, which garanteed us a result closer to the expected constant value. During my test I found out a longer exposition simulation is really helpful for fitting background spectra from WFI, but doesn't make a big difference in the cluster spectra fitting, so I personally chose to avoid doing it to save time in my simulations, but someone may find the improvement in cluster spectra fit big enough to need taking it into considerations and choose to make a longer exposure simulation also for the complete simulation. The difference in exposure time between the complete/cluster image and the particle background image doesn't create introduce any issue in the spectral fits as it only change the counts numerosity but not the shape of their spectral distribution function."

    "The **script** makes a **fit of the spectra** on a spectral model made simply summing the background and cluster model used for the simput creations, the former multiplyed for a scaling factor depending on the annulus area **to derive a temperature value of the source at each radius**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief explanation of **how it works** (which will eventually explain the .pha files choise we made, as shown above):\n",
    "\n",
    "**1)** We start with the cluster component of the spectral model frozen, with 0-value norm and we fit the \n",
    "background spectra from the outer annulus. This will give us a background temperature and fit for the outer region of the image. The particle background spectra for this annulus is subtracted (backgrnd command) to the sky component.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2)** We freeze the background components and thaw the cluster component. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each source annulus:\n",
    "\n",
    "**3)** We multiply the background component scaling factor for the area ratio between the outer background annulus and the current source annulus. This to take into account the lower number of counts from the background we expect in a smaller area. \n",
    "\n",
    "**4)** We subtract the particle background spectra in the annulus and we fit, deriving the source temperature and abundance while the background componend is fixed\n",
    "\n",
    "**5)** Save the fit parameters we need and their errors into a file (tclout command) for using it in any subsequent analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In the complete code we also save the spectra plots, fits and chi-squared values for each energy bin (cpd command) and make reference to a more organized directory strucure, but this is all customary and not strictly necessary."
